This script generates a 3D benchmark dataset for the specified GPU. Yes, in most cases you would
use a blanketed benchmark test for each GPU, but this is a good way to test the performance of the GPU due
to it being specified for said specific GPU. This will also expand to utilizing tests
for pipelines in regards to CPUs->GPUs->DPUs. Some benchmarks can and will be similar.
