# Cyclops
GUI tool for analyzing hardware.

## Description
This tool, hopefully one to add to your toolbelt, utilizes differing information about a board. It helps with testing such as benchmarking, power testing and simulating. Utilizing Vulkan and OpenGL to run benchmarks and render 3D objects of boards with datapoints.

## Getting started
Clone the repo and you can run a multitude of commands but just running the setup script should help. For now it is Windows Based but might do some side by side Linux and Windows updates.

Windows
```
.\run_setup.bat
```

## TODO:

Redo ARM's PATRACE application.

Begin with ARM chipsets and move onto others.

Add Vulkan and OpenGL third party libraries

Add Vulkan and OpenGL rendering

Add Vulkan and OpenGL benchmarking

Add Vulkan and OpenGL simulation

Add Vulkan and OpenGL power testing

Add Vulkan and OpenGL debugging

Add Vulkan and OpenGL profiling

Add Vulkan and OpenGL validation layers

Add Vulkan shading language support (SPIR-V)

Implement Vulkan and OpenGL into the GUI

Implement Vulkan and OpenGL code testing

Add Vulkan and OpenGL documentation (for third party libraries, standards, etc.)

Add github actions for CI/CD


### Chipsets:
- ARM :
  - mali -> models (G615, G715, Immortalis-G715): Valhall 4th gen

## Why am I doing this?
I really love GPU programming and embedded solutions as a whole. I started with creating games with C/C++ and this is a little bit of a homage to said memories.
