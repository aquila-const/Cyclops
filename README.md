# Cyclops
GUI tool for analyzing hardware.

## Description
This tool, hopefully one to add to your toolbelt, utilizes differing information about a board. It helps with testing such as benchmarking, power testing and simulating. Utilizing Vulkan and OpenGL to run benchmarks and render 3D objects of boards with datapoints.

## Getting started
Clone the repo and you can run a multitude of commands but just running the setup script should help. For now it is Windows Based but might do some side by side Linux and Windows updates.

Windows
```
.\run_setup.bat
```
